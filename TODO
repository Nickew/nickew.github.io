commit changes:
  added fullPage library (react version)
  moved ProjectsProvider up to MainPage
  refactored LatestProjects component
  refactored LatestSection to LatestProject (now it's supposed to work as container for single project)
  removed SectionTransition, instead created logic with fullPage onLeave method
  tweaked previously transitioned and section--white classes in base.scss
  refactored ArrowUpContainer logic, now it depends on fullPage in MainPage page
  added class "section" to Header, Section and Footer components for fullPage support
  added justifyContent prop to Grid component
  added togglePageFading util functions, which adds and removes "faded" class. It has two separated functions instead of one which just toggles class because of how fullPage works (maybe there is another way of doing this)
  removed react-scroll library. fullPage library has it own moveTo animation method

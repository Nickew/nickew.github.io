              I always had a passion to create things, thatâ€™s why I went
              studying programming. After 2 years of learning object-oriented
              programming and software architecturing got me bored. By that time{' '}
              {"I've"} done some projects with programming languages like C#,
              Java - and did it pretty well but still wanted to try other things
              that might be more enjoyable. Not gonna lie I chose front-end only
              because I liked how it sounds furthermore I had already some
              experience with web-dev back in middle school. At the beginning of
              learning it was easy to follow just some html and css. At other
              hand there is JavaScript - which is hard to learn without any
              help. There was a time when I burned out because of many
              unfamiliar tools which I was trying to use without even knowing
              what they are for (it was webpack/redux/sagas). After a while I
              did actually back to further learning and enjoyed every moment.
              For now it not so enjoyable as it was but I kinda used to web-dev
              already.

  about: `
    <p>
      My name is Nikita, I’m self-taught front-end developer with Software
      Engineering background.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my first 2 years in university I learned C# OOP, which was great
      experience for me but still not what I wanted to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s when I stared to learn front-end development throughtout
      courses, articles and etc. One of the most impactful free courses I
      found for myself as a web beginner was FreecodeCamp which was easy
      to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today most of the time I’m working on freelance with HTML/CSS/JS and
      PHP (Wordpress, OpenCart). In free time I’m enjoying my time with
      React side-projects development.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m based in Kyiv, Ukraine and looking for a REACT FRONT-END JOB.
